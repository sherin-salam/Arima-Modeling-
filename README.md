# Arima is an acronym that stands for AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average
AR: Autoregression. A model that uses the dependent relationship between an observation and some number of lagged observations.
I: Integrated. Use of differencing of raw observations (e.g. subtracting an observation from an observation at the previous time step) in order to make the time series stationary.
MA: Moving Average. A model that uses the dependency between an observation and a residual error from a moving average model applied to lagged observations.
